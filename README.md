# protocol-upgrade-mechanism

The prurpose of this repository is to create a mechanism for automatically performing updates of the Mina protocol (hard forks).

Currently, we are collecting requirements in the form of issues. There is also discussion happening at [MinaResearch](https://forums.minaprotocol.com/t/automated-protocol-upgrade-mechanism/6662). In the future, we will add design documents, and ultimately also code.

Also see the accompanying [github project](https://github.com/orgs/MinaFoundation/projects/15/views/1) for a well-organized view on the requirements.
